# Pac-Moose

## Description
Pac-Moose is a simple, Pac-Man-inspired game I created to accompany invitations to my dog Moose's birthday party. 

### Components
- Fries: Each fry is a point, with the carton worth more.
- El: Adds points. Removes Steven temporarily from the board. 
- Steven: Subtracts points. It turns into a red ghost when run into.
- Red squares: Go through a red square and pop out on the opposite end of the board.
